# TechDrawTitleBlockUtility
This workbench is developed to import data for the titleblock in your TechDraw drawing.

## The main functions are:
- Load the data (editable fields with or without values) from your drawing into a spreadsheet
- Export the data to an excel workbook
- Import data from an excel workbook to a spreadsheet
- Fill the titleblock on all pages in your document from data in the spreadsheet
- Export the workbench settings to a excel workbook
- Import the workbook settings from a excel workbook at startup

There are three main ways to use this workbench:
1. Use a spreadsheet with data to fill titleblocks in a document with multiple TechDraw pages
2. Use a central Excel workbook when working with multiple documents. You can set standard data like Project name, approver name, etc.
3. Use a central Excel workbook on a shared location when working with multiple people on a project.
   Like with way 2, you can set standard date but also synchronise workbook settings among all users.
