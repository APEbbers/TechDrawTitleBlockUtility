# TitleBlock Workbench

Ta FreeCAD workbench to provide a convient way to fill in titleblocks for multiple TechDraw pages in one or more CAD files.
This workbench makes use of the interal workbench SpreadSheet and Microsoft Excel workbooks

The main functions of the workbench are:
- Load the data (editable fields with or without values) from your drawing into a spreadsheet
- Export the data to an excel workbook
- Import data from an excel workbook to a spreadsheet
- Fill the titleblock on all pages in your document from data in the spreadsheet
- increase values per page. For example page numbers
- Export the workbench settings to a excel workbook
- Import the workbook settings from a excel workbook at startup

There are three main ways to use this workbench:
1. Use a spreadsheet with data to fill titleblocks in a document with multiple TechDraw pages
2. Use a single Excel workbook when working with multiple documents. You can set standard data like Project name, approver name, etc.
3. Use a single Excel workbook on a shared location when working with multiple people on a project.
   Like with way 2, you can set standard data but also synchronise workbench settings among all users.
